# FAME: Feature Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings for Deepfake Model Attribution

**FAME** is a lightweight, spatio-temporal deep learning architecture designed for **Deepfake model attribution** ‚Äî identifying the source generative model behind manipulated face-swap videos. It combines VGG-based frame-level representation with LSTM-based temporal attention for robust multi-class classification.

> üîí **Note:** The source code and pretrained models will be released shortly upon acceptance/publication.

## üß† Overview

- üß© Combines truncated VGG19 for spatial feature extraction with Bi-LSTM for temporal modeling
- üîç Attention module to highlight salient frames in video sequences
- üí° Designed for attribution across multiple Deepfake generation models, not just detection
- ‚ö° Lightweight and efficient, suitable for real-time or resource-constrained deployment

## üìà Key Results

FAME has been evaluated on multiple public benchmarks:

| Dataset         | Accuracy (%) | Macro F1 Score | AUC     |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| DFDM            | 97.3         | 0.975          | 0.999   |
| FaceForensics++ | 96.4         | 0.968          | 0.997   |
| FakeAVCeleb     | 84.6         | 0.841          | 0.986   |

FAME shows strong generalization across different types of face-swap and GAN-based Deepfake generators.

## üì¶ Code & Models

The codebase will include:

- Full PyTorch implementation of the FAME model
- Training & evaluation scripts
- Support for DFDM, FF++, and FakeAVCeleb datasets
- Pretrained model checkpoints (to be released)

> ‚è≥ **Coming Soon**: The code and models will be publicly released on this repository upon official acceptance/publication.
